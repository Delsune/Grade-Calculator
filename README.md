A simple grade calculator for finding average GPAs and course grades.

Guide:
1. When entering numbers into each box, hit the "Enter" button next to the input boxes to actually record the numbers in the app.
2. If you try entering more grades or weightings than courses/course materials, the excess grades or weightings will not be recorded, so you have to increase the number of courses/course materials first.
3. Average GPAs and average course grades are automatically rounded to 2 decimal places.
4. If you are calculating average GPA, you have no need to enter course weightings. Course weightings are only necessary for calculating course grades.
