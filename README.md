A simple grade calculator for finding average GPAs and course grades.

Guide:
    1. When entering numbers into each box, hit the "Enter" button next to the input boxes to actually record the numbers in the app.
    2. If you try entering more grades than courses/course materials, the excess grades will not be recorded, so you have to increase the number of courses/course materials first.
    3. Average GPAs and course grades are automatically rounded to 2 decimal places.
